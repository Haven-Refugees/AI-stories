## Summary:

I'm Ali Hassan, originally from Aleppo, Syria, a city where my family's safety has been compromised, stripping us of normalcy. Uneducated formally, my chances diminished, yet my resolve to secure a better future for my children remains unshaken. We’ve embarked on a journey to Canada as asylum seekers, fueled by the hope of safety, stability, and the opportunity for our children to pursue education and dreams unhindered by war. I long to take an active role in my new community in Manitoba, to learn English, and to support others with similar stories. My aspirations are not just for my family's security but also to become a positive role model, contributing to our new society with resilience and gratitude. My story is one of courage, facing tremendous hardship with the hope of giving back to the community in Manitoba that I wish to call home.
