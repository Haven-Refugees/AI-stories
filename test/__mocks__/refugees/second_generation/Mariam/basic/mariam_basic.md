## Summary

I am Mariam Oumarou, a woman of strength shaped by trials that have taught me resilience. Originating from Niger, I have faced the turmoil of instability and political unrest that made life hazardous. As a single individual, without family by my side, navigating each day has been a testament to courage. Yet, my hope is steadfast. I seek a tranquil existence in the welcoming arms of Canada—specifically, Quebec, where I yearn to contribute positively and build a stable, serene life.

Armed with a Master's degree and fluent in both French and English, I stand ready to embrace new educational opportunities and surround myself with positivity. My experiences have honed an unwavering determination to reconstruct my life amidst security and stability. I currently find myself in Niamey, but Montreal is the city I aspire to call home, where I aim to continue my studies and flourish within a community that values diversity and resilience. In Canada, I am determined to turn over a new leaf, filled with the promise of peace and prosperity.
