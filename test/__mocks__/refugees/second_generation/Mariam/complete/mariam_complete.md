## Conversation between Questioner and Mariam (complete)

**Interviewer:** Bonjour Mariam, thank you for sharing your journey with us. Your resilience in the face of challenges is truly inspiring. Could you tell me more about the personal and family challenges you have encountered?

**Mariam:** Hello, thank you for your kind words. As a woman living alone in Niger, I have faced social challenges such as insecurity and lack of job opportunities, as well as pressure to conform to traditional gender roles.

**Interviewer:** I understand it must be very difficult to navigate between social pressure and the pursuit of independence and opportunities. How have you managed these pressures to stay true to your aspirations and personal goals?

**Mariam:** To stay true to my goals, I have always prioritized education and perseverance. I have surrounded myself with people who share my values and encourage me.

## Summary:

My name is Mariam Oumarou, originally from Niger, and my life has been one of resilience amid political unrest and societal challenges. As a woman on my own, I've faced many hurdles, but my commitment to a better life has remained unwavering. The move to Canada represents my longing for security, stability, and opportunities to apply my education and skills. My story is about overcoming adversity with the goal of making a positive impact in my new community in Quebec.

Navigating social pressures while seeking independence has been tough, but I’ve always prioritized education and perseverance. I've surrounded myself with people who support my values and encourage me. Living alone as a woman in Niger has confronted me with social challenges such as insecurity and a lack of job opportunities, as well as pressures to conform to traditional female roles.

I am now in Canada with refugee status, eager to integrate into Montreal society. My journey has not only been about personal triumphs but also about maintaining the determination to contribute meaningfully to the vibrant fabric of Quebec. I seek support to navigate this new chapter, propelled by the desire to use my master's degree and bilingualism in French and English to thrive in my resettlement province.
