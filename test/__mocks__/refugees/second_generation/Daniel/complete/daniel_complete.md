## Conversation between Questioner and Daniel (complete)

**Daniel**: Hello, Daniel. I believe that making the decision to immigrate to Canada and bringing about changes in one's family is a very courageous act. I'm curious about the personal and social challenges you faced in Seoul, and how they impacted you and your family.

**Daniel**: Our family felt restricted in personal freedom and expression, which limited our children's ability to freely explore their opinions and creativity. This environment greatly influenced our decision to immigrate to Canada.

**Interviewer**: It's truly touching to see parents who prioritize their children's creativity and freedom of expression. How has this decision strengthened the resilience of you and your family, and how do you think these experiences will help you adapt to the new environment and contribute to the Vancouver community?

**Daniel**: Our family has become stronger by overcoming difficulties together. These experiences in our new life in Vancouver will contribute positively to the community, based on patience and collaboration.

## Summary:

My name is Daniel Kim, hailing from Seoul, South Korea. My family and I have decided to embark on a journey to Vancouver, Canada, driven by our desire for a safe environment, and better educational opportunities for our children, within a community that values diversity and inclusivity. Despite having a stable life in Seoul, we encountered personal and societal challenges that limited the future outlook for our kids, restraining their freedom of expression and creativity. These difficulties have not only tested but also strengthened our family's resilience.

Moving to Canada signifies our determination to provide our children with the freedom to explore their own opinions and creativity without restrictions. The struggles we've faced have prepared us to adapt to new environments and contribute positively to the community in Vancouver. We eagerly look forward to starting anew and bringing our experiences of perseverance and collaboration to enrich the lives of those around us and ours.
