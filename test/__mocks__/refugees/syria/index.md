Hi Ahmed, I would love to know more about your experience. Can you tell me in detail about the challenges you and your family faced in Syria and how you were able to overcome these difficulties?

Hello, Because of the war we had to flee for our lives. In Syria, we lost our home and our stability. We faced many difficulties, but we maintained solidarity as a family.

Being able to stay united as a family has been a huge support without a doubt. Can you share with me a specific story that shows how family spirit and togetherness helped you through those difficult times?
**refugee**:
Yes, in the camp food was limited, but we always shared what we had. The adults give priority to the children and we gather what little we have to have warm meals together. This strengthens our bonds.

`Summary`:
My name is Ahmed Al-Mustafa, and my journey has been one of resilience and hope. Back in Damascus, Syria, where I was born, I worked as a civil engineer dedicated to infrastructure projects that sustain communities. The crowning achievement of my career was the completion of a significant bridge project, a symbol of connection and unity in a region often divided by conflict. But war has no regard for such endeavors, and soon, my family and I were caught in its fury. We lost our home, our stability, and were forced to seek refuge. Despite the many challenges, we, as a family, have always stood together, sharing whatever little we had, ensuring our children never felt the lack of warmth or togetherness even when the world outside was cold and chaotic. Now, as we search for a new beginning in Canada, I am eager to bring my skills and experience to a nation known for its vast landscapes and the bridges that link them, both structurally and culturally. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to my new community in Ontario, potentially in Toronto, where I can apply my expertise in engineering and maybe, in time, help to construct not just physical bridges, but those of understanding and support within the society that welcomes us.
