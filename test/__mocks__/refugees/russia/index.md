`Summary`:

I embarked on a journey toward a new life in Canada with a heart full of hope and a resolve to overcome past fears. In Russia, my homeland, freedom of expression was a veil that fluttered mercilessly in the winds of political unease. There, I took a stand for truth and justice, voicing opinions that echoed like thunder in hallways where silence was the unwritten law. It was not without consequence; threats loomed over like storm clouds threatening to burst. Despite the brewing storm, my determination never wavered. Upholding my beliefs, I became a beacon for some and a target for others. Education, my chosen path, became the vessel I aspired to carry forward, intent on nurturing diversity and critical thought among young minds. The risks I took were not only for my own virtue but for the betterment of a future I yearned to shape. Support from friends was a gentle nudge toward bravery, yet it was my personal conviction that steered the course to Canada. I set sail upon turbulent waters, adopting French and seeking recognition for my educational expertise, all so that one day, I might contribute to the Canadian tapestry as a teacher. In Quebec, specifically Montreal, I see my dream unfurling—immersing myself within its vibrant culture, dedicated to education, and impassioned to share the lessons etched deep in my spirit. This is my story, one of courage and education, of leaving behind what was once home to embrace a land that holds the promise of safety, expression, and opportunity.
