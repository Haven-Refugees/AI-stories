`Summary`:
My name is Olena Kovalenko, and I would like to share my journey of seeking a new life in Canada amidst the turmoil of conflict in my homeland, Ukraine. As a product manager in the IT industry, I have honed skills that I am eager to contribute to my new community. The war brought fear and uncertainty, but it also united my family as we supported one another through the loss of our home and the quest for safety. Emigrating is our chance for a peaceful future. Together with my family of three, I arrived in Canada with hope, ready to embrace the warmth and hospitality I know is innate to Canadians, mirroring the spirit of my Ukrainian people. I dream of finding stability in the IT sector in British Columbia, specifically in Vancouver, to provide for my loved ones and build a secure life. Our traditions, especially celebrating Christmas and Easter, are treasures I'm excited to share. I hold dear values of community and resilience, as we Ukrainians are strong together. Now, in Canada, I am determined to adapt and thrive, driven by dreams of peace and stability for my family.
